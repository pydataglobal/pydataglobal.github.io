An annual tradition! The famed PyData Pop Quiz (previously held at PyData Seattle, London, NYC, Amsterdam....) comes to PyData Global.
Test your knowledge of Python and the NumFOCUS/PyData stack against the best and brightest worldwide. Same event held 2x.

(Event will be held 2x to accommodate a global audience - no need to come to both, just join the one that best fits your time zone.)

Brought to you by Quizmasters James Powell and Lauren Oldja.

**The Pub Quiz will happen in the bar on Gather. Each table is a Gather private space so you can discuss answers with your team. Find a group, find a table, pick a team name (Code of Conduct friendly please!), decide who will write the answers, and prepare for the Inquizition!**
